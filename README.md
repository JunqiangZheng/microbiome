#Microbiome package and usage
<p>
  This is a sample workflow for several microbial community analysis
</p>
<p>
  First thing first though. Lets install the package.
  <br/>
  (if not already done)
  <br/><br/>
  
  ``` 
  install.packages("devtools")
  ```
  
  <br/><br/>
  
  Once installed, you'll need to use that package to install this one.
  
  <br/><br/>
  
  ```
  library(devtools)
  ```
  
  <br/>
  
  ```
  install_github("jtclaypool/microbiome")
  ```
</p>
