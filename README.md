#Microbiome package and usage

This is a sample workflow for several microbial community analysis
<br/><br/>
First thing first though. Lets install the package.
<br/>
(if not already done)
<br/><br/>
  
``` 
install.packages("devtools")
```

<br/><br/>

Once installed, you'll need to use that package to install this one.

<br/><br/>

```
library(devtools)
```

<br/>

```
install_github("jtclaypool/microbiome")
```
