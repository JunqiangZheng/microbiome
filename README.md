#Microbiome package and usage

This is a sample workflow for several microbial community analysis
<br/><br/>

First thing first though. Lets install the package.
<br/>

(if not already done)

<br/>
  
``` 
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once installed, you'll need to use that package to install this one.

<br/>

```
library(devtools)
install_github("jtclaypool/microbiome")
```
